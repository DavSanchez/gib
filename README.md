# `gib` - A `.gitignore` bootstrapper for projects using `git`
![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gib)
![Travis CI build](https://travis-ci.com/DavSanchez/gib.svg?branch=master)
![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/gib/0.1.0)

## Installation
You can download the released versions for the available platforms [on GitHub's releases page](https://github.com/DavSanchez/gib/releases) **(Windows hopefully coming soon!)**

Additionally, if you have installed Rust on your machine, you can just do:
```bash
cargo install gib
```

## Usage
### Create `.gitignore` at current directory (if it doesn't exist)
```bash
$ gib [<template>...] 
```

If a `.gitignore` file already exists at that location, `gib` will do nothing.

**\[Coming soon:\]** If you want to extend an existing file instead, use the `-a|--append` flag. If you want to overwrite it, use `-r|--replace`.

### Create `.gitignore` at other directory
```bash
$ gib [<template>...] [-o|--output] [<path>]
```

### Get list of available templates
```bash
$ gib [-l|--list]
```

### Print result of specified templates to `stdout` only
```bash
$ gib [<template>...] [-s|--show]
```

## Examples
### Output `.gitignore` file for Go and Rust
```bash
$ gib go rust
```
#### `.gitignore`
```

## Pending changes
- [ ] Template file paths are not correctly generated for Windows. Critical for Windows release.
- [ ] Additional means of installation (`brew` for macOS, etc.)
- [ ] Add `append` and `replace` flags for working with existing `.gitignore` files.
- [ ] Replace `.gitignore` template loading with [`lazy_static`](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/) or [`phf`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf)?
- [ ] The build process at `build.rs` assumes the `gitignore` submodule is present and correctly loaded. It should test that before anything else.
